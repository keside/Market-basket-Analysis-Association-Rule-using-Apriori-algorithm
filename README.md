Masket Basket Analysis description
Market basket analysis is the study of items that are likely to be purchased together. Its aim is to discover groups of items that are frequently purchased together so that stores or e-commerce websites can better organize their layouts. This is usually done so that complimentary items that belong to one group are placed together in the store. In an MBA, the transactions are analysed to identify rules of association. For example, one rule could be: {pencil, paper} => {rubber}. This means that if a customer has a transaction that contains a pencil and paper, then they are likely to be interested in also buying a rubber.

To perform a Market Basket Analysis and identify potential rules, a data mining algorithm called the ‘Apriori algorithm’ is commonly used, which works in two steps:

    1. Systematically identify itemsets that occur frequently in the data set with a support greater than a pre-specified threshold.
    2. Calculate the confidence of all possible rules given the frequent itemsets and keep only those with a confidence greater than a pre-specified threshold.
